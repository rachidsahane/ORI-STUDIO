# Lock table

Held by the lead until `ori-orchestrator::LockTable` owns it (ORI-T-0050). Every claim and release is recorded here, in order. AICD §12, conflict handling at scale.

| # | Ticket | Modules claimed | Claimed | Released |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ORI-T-0006 | `ops/methodology-anchor-defects.md` | batch 1 open | |
| 2 | ORI-T-0007 | `spec/agents/CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md` | batch 1 open | |
| 2b | ORI-T-0007 | extended: `spec/agents/coder.md`, `spec/README.md` | granted on re-declaration, ruling R7; neither claimed | |
| 3 | ORI-T-0008 | `.claude/agents/**` | batch 1 open | |
| 4 | ORI-T-0009 | `templates/**` | batch 1 open | |
| 5 | ORI-T-0011 | `spec/adr/ADR-0002-single-operator.md` | batch 1 open | |

| 7 | ORI-T-0003 | `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.gitignore`, `scripts/setup-dev.sh` | batch 1 wave 2 | |
| 8 | ORI-T-0004 | `scripts/gates.sh` | batch 1 wave 2 | |
| 9 | ORI-T-0005 | `methodology/sections.json`, `crates/ori-gates/src/sections.rs`, the `mod` line in `crates/ori-gates/src/lib.rs` | batch 1 wave 2 | |
| 10 | ORI-T-0002 | `apps/desktop/**`, root `Cargo.toml` members entry, `Cargo.lock` (ruling R21) | batch 1 wave 2 | |

No two claims overlap, verified mechanically before the claims were granted. ORI-T-0001 through 0005, 0010 and 0012 through 0018 are unclaimed: 0010 is held on a missing precondition (the organizational repository), the rest are held on the Rust toolchain.
