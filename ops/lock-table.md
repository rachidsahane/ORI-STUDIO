# Lock table

Held by the lead until `ori-orchestrator::LockTable` owns it (ORI-T-0050). Every claim and release is recorded here, in order. AICD §12, conflict handling at scale.

Claims 11 and 12 released on merge (ORI-T-0013, ORI-T-0014).

Claim 13, ORI-T-0016. Granted `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `fixtures/planted/gate-7/**`. **Extended mid-ticket** under ruling R28 to `deny.toml`, `scripts/secret-scan.sh` and `scripts/gates.sh`, because a dependency policy the whole repository is judged by and a scanner a gate invokes do not belong in a fixture directory. **The lead granted that extension in a prompt and failed to record it here, so a reviewer correctly reported `scripts/gates.sh` as an unrecorded scope violation.** Same failure as rulings R15 to R24: a grant exists when it is written here, not when the lead states it. Recorded now.

Claim 14, ORI-T-0084. Granted `fixtures/planted/gate-1/workflow-samples/**`. The claim also named `ops/gates/gate-1.md` and `ops/gates/gate-2.md`, which was an error: ruling R25 makes operational records the lead's, so the ticket could not have used them. Released to the lead. **Extended to `fixtures/planted/gate-2/README.md`**, held by the lead rather than the coder, to correct a statement the ticket's own repair made false; nothing else claims it.

ORI-T-0017 remains queued behind claim 13. All four claim `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, so the lock table refuses a parallel start and they run serially, each branched from the previous. Splitting the planted defects into parallel worktrees and serializing only the YAML edit was considered and rejected: it is the lead routing around its own control to save wall clock, in the project whose product is the control.

Claim 15, ORI-T-0018. **Granted nothing, because it was never claimed.** The ticket ran, branched, committed and opened a pull request with no row in this table, and `ops/phase-1-backlog.md` declares its scope as `crates/ori-core/src/lib.rs` while the change landed in `crates/ori-cli/src/main.rs`. Nothing collided, because nothing else was in flight, which is the only reason this cost nothing. Recorded now as held and released together: `crates/ori-cli/src/main.rs`, plus `ops/gates/gate-2.md`, `ops/gates/gate-13.md`, `ops/rulings.md` and this file, all lead records under ruling R25.

This is the fourth occurrence of one failure: a grant or a record that exists in the lead's intent and not in a file. See CR-005.

No two claims overlap, verified mechanically before the claims were granted. ORI-T-0001 through 0005, 0010 and 0012 through 0018 are unclaimed: 0010 is held on a missing precondition (the organizational repository), the rest are held on the Rust toolchain.
