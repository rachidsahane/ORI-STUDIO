# Screen: map and evolution

The product map and how it changed over time. `spec/PRD.md` section 6 names it
"Map and evolution".

## What belongs here

The route, the layout and the components only this screen uses. Anything a
second screen needs moves to `../../components`.

## What does not

Engine access. This screen reads from `../../store` and calls `../../rpc`; it
does not call `invoke`, `fetch` or a Tauri event listener of its own
(`spec/ARCHITECTURE.md` section 4: the UI has no private path into the engine).

## Tier

`spec/RISK_MAP.md`: tier 0 for styling and layout, tier 1 for anything that
sends an RPC.
